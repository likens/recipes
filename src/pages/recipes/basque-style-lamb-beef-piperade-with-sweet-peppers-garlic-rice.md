    measurement: cup
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and mince the garlic. Cut off
      and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice. Finely chop the
      almonds. Finely chop the parsley leaves and stems. Cut off and discard the
      stem ends of the peppers; remove and discard the ribs and seeds, then cut
      into ¼-inch-thick rings. Peel and thinly slice the shallot.
  - direction: In a small pot, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until
      hot. Add half the garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the rice, a big pinch
      of salt and 1½ cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover
      and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has
      been absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove from heat and fluff with a
      fork. Set aside in a warm place.
  - direction: While the rice cooks, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one),
      heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the scallions;
      season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes,
      or until browned. Add ¼ cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to
      3 minutes, or until the scallions have softened and the water has cooked
      off; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the to a bowl and set
      aside in a warm place. Wipe out the pan.
  - direction: While the rice continues to cook, in a large bowl, combine the ground
      lamb and beef, almonds, remaining garlic, breadcrumbs and all but a big
      pinch of the parsley; season with salt and pepper. Gently mix to combine.
      Using your hands, form the mixture into 6 oval-shaped, 1-inch-thick
      patties. Transfer to a plate. In the same pan, heat 1 teaspoon of olive
      oil on medium-high until hot. Add the patties and cook 2 to 3 minutes per
      side, or until browned. Transfer to a plate, leaving any browned bits (or
      fond) in the pan.
  - direction: Add the peppers to the pan; season with salt and pepper. (If the pan
      seems dry, add 2 teaspoons of olive oil.) Cook on medium-high, stirring
      occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the shallot;
      season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes,
      or until lightly browned. Add the tomato paste; cook, stirring frequently,
      1 to 2 minutes, or until dark red. Add the vinegar and ¾ cup of water (be
      careful, as the liquid may splatter); cook, stirring and scraping up any
      fond, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thickened.
  - direction: Add the browned patties and ¼ cup of water to the pan. Cook,
      frequently spooning the sauce over the patties, 3 to 4 minutes, or until
      the patties are thoroughly coated and cooked through. Season with salt and
      pepper to taste. Divide the finished patties and sauce between 2 dishes.
      Garnish with the ground Espelette pepper and remaining parsley. Divide the
      garlic rice between 2 separate dishes and top with the cooked scallions.
      Enjoy!
