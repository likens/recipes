    measurement: ounce
  - name: garlic cloves
    quantity: "3"
  - name: plum tomato
    quantity: "1"
  - name: tomato paste
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: whole grain dijon mustard
    quantity: "1.5"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: shallot
    quantity: "1"
  - name: apple cider vinegar
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: barbecue sauce
    quantity: 1/2
    measurement: cup
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. Peel the shallot and mince to get 2 tablespoons (you may
      have extra); place in a bowl with the vinegar and season with salt and
      pepper. Snap off and discard the stem ends of the green beans. Peel and
      mince the garlic. Core and small dice the tomato. Halve the buns.
  - direction: Fill a medium bowl with ice water and set aside. Add the green beans
      to the pot of boiling water and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until bright green
      and slightly softened. Drain thoroughly and transfer to the bowl of ice
      water; let stand until completely cool. Drain thoroughly. Wipe out the
      pot.
  - direction: While the green beans cool, in the same pot, heat 1 teaspoon of olive
      oil on medium-high until hot. Add the ground beef and season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, frequently breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 3 to 5
      minutes, or until browned and cooked through.
  - direction: Add the tomato paste and garlic to the pot; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the tomato
      paste is dark red and fragrant. Add the barbecue sauce and 1 cup of water.
      Simmer, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits from the
      bottom of the pot, 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Remove
      from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - direction: While the filling simmers, in a large bowl, combine the blanched
      green beans, tomato, mustard and as much of the shallot-vinegar mixture as
      youâ€™d like; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and toss
      to coat; season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - direction: While the filling continues to simmer, in a medium pan (nonstick, if
      you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add
      the buns, cut sides down, and toast 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly
      browned. Transfer to a work surface. Divide the finished filling between
      the toasted bun bottoms (you may have extra filling). Top with the pickle
      chips. Complete the sandwiches with the bun tops. Divide the sandwiches
      and salad between 2 dishes. Enjoy!
