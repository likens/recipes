directions:
  - direction: Pound each out chicken breast to about 1/2 inch thick width. Season
      each side of the breast to taste.
  - direction: Place the chicken in a container with the italian dressing as the
      marinade. Let it marinade overnight or at least 30 minutes.
  - direction: Add the tablespoons of oil to a skillet on medium-high heat.
  - direction: Once the oil is smoking, add all the chicken to the skillet and sear
      4 to 5 minutes each side.
  - direction: While the chicken is going, combine the parmesan, provolone, and
      ranch dressing. Stir to combine and microwave in 15 second increments
      while stirring in between. Once it reaches a lumpy, mashed potato like
      consistency, set aside.
  - direction: Combine the melted butter, garlic powder, and panko. Stir well and
      set aside.
  - direction: Prepare your oven to broil at about 450 degrees.
  - direction: Once the chicken is finished, place all the breasts on an oven-safe
      pan. Add the ranch-cheese mixture to the top of each breast in similar
      amounts.
  - direction: Broil for about 3 minutes or until the cheese is slightly brown.
      Remove from the oven.
  - direction: Add the panko mixture to each breast evenly. Add back to the oven and
      broil for about 1 minute or until the breadcrumbs are slightly brown.
  - direction: Serve with mashed potatoes, broccoli or green beans.
