ingredients:
  - name: boneless, skin-on chicken breats
    quantity: "2"
  - name: fregola sarda pasta
    quantity: 2/3
    measurement: cup
  - name: cloves of garlic
    quantity: "3"
  - name: ear of corn
    quantity: "1"
  - name: plum tomato
    quantity: "1"
  - name: bunch of parsley
    quantity: "1"
  - name: capers
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: red wine vinegar
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: grated parmesan cheese
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: cup
  - name: crushed red pepper flakes
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: teaspoon
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a small pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. Finely chop the capers. Finely chop the parsley leaves
      and stems. Peel and mince the garlic; smash with the side of your knife
      until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Remove and discard the husks
      and silks of the corn. Cut the corn kernels off the cob; discard the cob.
      Core and small dice the tomato.
  - direction: In a bowl, combine the vinegar, capers, parsley, half the cheese and
      ¼ of the garlic paste. Slowly stir in enough olive oil to create a rough
      paste; season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - direction: Add the pasta to the pot of boiling water and cook, uncovered, 8 to
      10 minutes, or until tender. Reserving ¼ cup of the pasta cooking water,
      drain thoroughly.
  - direction: While the pasta cooks, in a large, high-sided pan (or pot), heat 2
      teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the corn; season with
      salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until
      softened. Add the tomato, remaining garlic paste and as much of the red
      pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to
      be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3
      minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a bowl and set aside in a warm
      place. Wipe out the pan.
  - direction: While the pasta continues to cook, pat the chicken dry with paper
      towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2
      teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken,
      skin sides down, and cook 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and
      cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board, leaving any browned bits (or
      fond) in the pan, and set aside in a warm place.
  - direction: Add the cooked pasta, cooked vegetables and reserved pasta cooking
      water to the pan. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently and scraping up
      any fond from the bottom of the pan, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly
      combined and heated through. Remove from heat and season with salt and
      pepper to taste. Cut the cooked chicken crosswise into thirds. Divide the
      finished pasta and chicken between 2 dishes. Top the chicken with the
      salsa verde. Garnish with the remaining cheese. Enjoy!
