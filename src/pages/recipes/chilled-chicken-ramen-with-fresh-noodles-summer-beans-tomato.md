    quantity: "2"
  - name: cucumber
    quantity: "1"
  - name: tomato
    quantity: "1"
  - name: sesame oil
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: sugar
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: furikake
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: teaspoon
  - name: rice vinegar
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: cup
  - name: soy sauce
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: cup
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. Snap off and discard the stem ends of the beans; halve on
      an angle. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice
      on an angle, separating the white bottoms and green tops. Cut the tomato
      into 1-inch-wide wedges. In a bowl, combine the sugar, sesame oil, ¾ of
      the vinegar, half the soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of water; stir until the
      sugar has dissolved. Cut the cucumber into ¼-inch-thick rounds; transfer
      to a bowl and toss with half the remaining vinegar.
  - direction: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on
      both sides. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons
      of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4
      to 5 minutes on the first side, or until lightly browned. Flip the chicken
      and add ½ cup of water to the pan. Cook 4 to 6 minutes, or until the
      chicken is cooked through and the water has cooked off. Transfer to a
      cutting board and set aside to cool.
  - direction: While the chicken cooks, fill a large bowl with ice water and set
      aside. Add the beans to the pot of boiling water and cook 3 to 4 minutes,
      or until slightly softened. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the
      cooked beans to the bowl of ice water, leaving the pot of water boiling.
      Let the beans stand until completely cool. Drain thoroughly and pat dry
      with paper towels.
  - direction: Using 2 forks, shred the cooked chicken into large pieces. Transfer
      to a medium bowl. Add the white bottoms of the scallions, remaining soy
      sauce, remaining vinegar and half the furikake. Toss to combine; season
      with salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat.
  - direction: Add the noodles to the same pot of boiling water, stirring gently to
      separate. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly; rinse
      under cold water for 20 to 30 seconds to stop the cooking process. Divide
      between 2 bowls.
  - direction: Season the tomato and blanched beans with salt and pepper. Top the
      bowls of cooked noodles with the dressing, coated chicken, marinated
      cucumber and seasoned tomato and beans. Garnish with the green tops of the
      scallions and remaining furikake. Enjoy!
