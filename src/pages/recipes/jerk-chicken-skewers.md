directions:
  - direction: To avoid burning your skin, wear rubber or plastic gloves when you
      handle the chile. After handling the chile, do not touch your face or any
      other part of your body, as that might cause a burning reaction. Remove
      and distard the stem of the chile, then cut away and discard the hot
      whitish veins and seeds. Put the rest of the chile in the bowl of a food
      processor. Add the remaining paste ingredients and process until smooth.
  - direction: Trim the chicken of any fat and remove the tenders. Cut the chicken
      lengthwise into even strips. 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick
  - direction: Place the chicken strips and tenders into a large bowl, resealable
      plastic bag and spoon in the paste. Work the paste into the chicken, press
      the air out of the back, and seal tightly. Place in the refrigerator and
      let marinade for 2 to 3 hours.
  - direction: In a small bowl whisk the sauce ingredients. Cover with plastic wrap
      and refrigerate. Let the sauce stand at room temperature for about 30
      minutes before serving. Prepare the grill for direct cooking over high
      heat.
  - direction: Wearing rubber or plastic gloves, Thread the chicken strips onto the
      skewers being sure to keep each skewer well within the flesh of the
      chicken. If you don't have rubber gloves, be sure to wash your hands
      thoroughly after this step.
  - direction: Brush the cooking grates clean. Grill the skewers over direct high
      heat with the lid closed as much as possible until the meat is firm and
      the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once or twice. Serve warm.
