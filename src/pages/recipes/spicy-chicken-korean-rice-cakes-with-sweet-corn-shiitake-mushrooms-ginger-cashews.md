    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: ounce
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. In a medium bowl, combine the mushrooms and 1 cup of hot
      water; let stand for at least 10 minutes. Peel and mince the ginger.
      Roughly chop the cashews. Peel and mince the garlic. Cut off and discard
      the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice on an angle, separating the
      white bottoms and green tops. Remove and discard the husk and silk of the
      corn. Cut the corn kernels off the cob; discard the cob. Pat the chicken
      dry with paper towels and chop into bite-sized pieces; transfer to a bowl.
  - direction: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive
      oil on medium-high until hot. Add ¼ of the ginger; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until
      fragrant. Add the cashews and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 seconds to 1
      minute, or until lightly browned and fragrant. Transfer to a paper
      towel-lined plate; immediately season with salt and pepper to taste. Wipe
      out the pan.
  - direction: Add the rice cakes to the pot of boiling water and cook 2 to 3
      minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and set aside. Reserving the
      mushroom water, using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the mushrooms to
      a cutting board and finely chop.
  - direction: Season the chopped chicken with salt and pepper; toss to coat. In the
      pan used to make the gingered cashews, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
      medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook, stirring
      occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned.
  - direction: Add the garlic, white bottoms of the scallions and remaining ginger
      to the pan of chicken; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the corn;
      season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 30 seconds to 1
      minute, or until the corn is slightly softened. Add the reserved mushroom
      water and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes, or until most of
      the liquid has cooked off and the chicken is cooked through.
  - direction: To the pan of chicken and vegetables, add the cooked rice cakes
      (rinsing under warm water to loosen just before adding), chopped
      mushrooms, hoisin sauce, vinegar and as much of the gochujang as you’d
      like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thoroughly combined and saucy.
      Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide between
      2 dishes. Garnish with the gingered cashews and green tops of the
      scallions. Enjoy!
