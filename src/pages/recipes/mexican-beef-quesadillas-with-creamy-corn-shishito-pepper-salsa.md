directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the root ends of
      the scallions; thinly slice, separating the white bottoms and green tops.
      Remove and discard the husks and silks of the corn. Cut the corn kernels
      off the cob; discard the cob. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the
      peppers; cut into ½-inch pieces on an angle. Grate the cheese. Using a
      peeler, remove the green rind of the lime, avoiding the white pith; mince
      the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter the lime.
      In a large bowl, combine the crème fraîche and the juice of 2 lime wedges;
      season with salt and pepper.
  - direction: In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive
      oil on medium-high until hot. Add the ground beef; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, frequently breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 4 to 6
      minutes, or until browned and cooked through.
  - direction: Add the white bottoms of the scallions, tomato paste and spice blend
      to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened
      and fragrant. Add ¾ cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6
      minutes, or until thickened and saucy; season with salt and pepper to
      taste. Transfer to a bowl. Rinse and wipe out the pan.
  - direction: In the same pan, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until
      hot. Add the corn and peppers; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Remove from heat
      and stir in the lime zest. Transfer to the bowl of lime crème fraîche and
      toss to coat; season with salt and pepper to taste. Wipe out the pan.
  - direction: Place the tortillas on a clean, dry work surface. Sprinkle ¼ of the
      cheese onto 1 side of each tortilla; season with salt and pepper. Top with
      the filling, then the remaining cheese. Fold each tortilla in half over
      filling. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until
      hot. Add the quesadillas and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until the
      tortillas are golden brown and the cheese has melted. Transfer to a
      cutting board and let stand for 2 minutes.
  - direction: Cut the cooked quesadillas into thirds and divide between 2 plates.
      Top with the salsa. Garnish with the green tops of the scallions and
      remaining lime wedges. Enjoy
