ingredients:
  - name: ground chicken
    quantity: "10"
    measurement: ounce
  - name: fresh basil fettuccine pasta
    quantity: 1/2
    measurement: pound
  - name: cloves of garlic
    quantity: "3"
  - name: plum tomatoes
    quantity: "2"
  - name: red onion
    quantity: "1"
  - name: bunch of parsley
    quantity: "1"
  - name: tomato paste
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: crème fraîche
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: grated parmesan cheese
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: cup
  - name: crushed red pepper flakes
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: teaspoon
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a large pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. Peel and mince the garlic. Peel and small dice the onion.
      Core and small dice the tomatoes; transfer to a bowl and season with salt.
      Pick the parsley leaves off the stems; discard the stems and finely chop
      the leaves.
  - direction: In a large, high-sided pan (or pot), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
      medium-high until hot. Add the ground chicken; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, frequently breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 3 to 4
      minutes, or until browned and cooked through.
  - direction: Add the garlic and onion to the pan; season with salt and pepper.
      Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the
      tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until dark
      red and fragrant.
  - direction: To the pan, add the tomatoes, 1 cup of water and as much of the red
      pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to
      be; season with salt and pepper. Heat to simmering on high. Once
      simmering, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally and
      scraping up any browned bits (or fond) from the bottom of the pan, 8 to 10
      minutes, or until thickened and saucy.
  - direction: Once the sauce has cooked for 4 to 5 minutes, using your hands,
      carefully separate the strands of the pasta; add to the pot of boiling
      water. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until just shy of al dente (still slightly
      firm to the bite). Reserving ½ cup of the pasta cooking water, drain
      thoroughly.
  - direction: Add the cooked pasta, crème fraîche, all but a pinch of the parsley
      and half the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan of sauce. Cook,
      stirring vigorously to coat the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly
      combined. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually add the remaining pasta
      cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Season with salt and
      pepper to taste. Divide between 2 dishes. Garnish with the cheese and
      remaining parsley. Enjoy!
