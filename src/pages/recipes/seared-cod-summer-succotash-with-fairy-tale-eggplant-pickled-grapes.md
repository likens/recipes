    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Remove and discard any stems from the
      grapes; thinly slice into rounds. Medium dice the eggplant. Peel and mince
      the garlic. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly
      slice on an angle, separating the white bottoms and green tops. Remove and
      discard the husks and silks of the corn. Cut the corn kernels off the cob;
      discard the cob. Snap off and discard the stem ends of the green beans;
      cut into ½-inch pieces. Core and small dice the tomato.
  - direction: In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and a big pinch of salt;
      stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the grapes and stir to coat. Set
      aside to pickle, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes.
  - direction: While the grapes pickle, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one),
      heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the eggplant
      and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned
      and slightly softened; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate.
      Wipe out the pan.
  - direction: While the grapes continue to pickle, in the same pan, heat 2
      teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the garlic, white
      bottoms of the scallions, corn and green beans; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until softened and
      fragrant. Add the tomato and cooked eggplant; season with salt and pepper.
      Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened; season
      with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a plate. Rinse and wipe out the
      pan.
  - direction: Place the flour on a plate. Pat the cod fillets dry with paper
      towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Thoroughly coat the
      seasoned fillets in the flour (tapping off any excess). In the same pan,
      heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the coated
      fillets and cook 3 to 5 minutes on the first side, or until golden brown.
      Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until cooked through. Transfer to a paper
      towel-lined plate; immediately season with salt and pepper.
  - direction: Divide the succotash and cooked cod fillets between 2 dishes. Garnish
      with the green tops of the scallions. Top the fillets with the pickled
      grapes and as much of the pickling liquid as you’d like. Enjoy!
