    quantity: "4"
  - name: jasmine rice
    quantity: 1/2
    measurement: cup
  - name: baby bok choy
    quantity: "6"
    measurement: ounce
  - name: scallion
    quantity: "1"
  - name: cucumber
    quantity: "1"
  - name: hoisin sauce
    quantity: "3"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: rice vinegar
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: sesame oil
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: 1-inch piece of ginger
    quantity: "1"
  - name: sambal oelek
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Large dice the cucumber. Cut off and
      discard the root end of the scallion; thinly slice on an angle, separating
      the white bottom and green top. Peel and mince the ginger. Cut off and
      discard the root end of the bok choy; separate the leaves. Pat the chicken
      dry with paper towels and chop into bite-sized pieces.
  - direction: In a small pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt and 1 cup of
      water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to
      low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the
      rice is tender. Remove from heat and fluff the cooked rice with a fork.
  - direction: While the rice cooks, in a large bowl, combine the cucumber, vinegar,
      half the sesame oil, half the green top of the scallion and ¼ of the
      ginger. Season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Set aside to marinate,
      stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. Season with salt and
      pepper to taste.
  - direction: While the salad marinates, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have
      one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the
      chopped chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned on all sides.
  - direction: Add the bok choy, white bottom of the scallion, remaining sesame oil
      and remaining ginger to the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook,
      stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bok choy has wilted.
  - direction: To the pan, add the hoisin sauce, ½ cup of water and as much of the
      sambal oelek as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to
      be. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 10 to 12
      minutes, or until the chicken is thoroughly coated and cooked through;
      season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the cooked rice and finished
      chicken and vegetables between 2 dishes. Divide the salad between 2
      separate dishes. Garnish with the remaining green top of the scallion.
      Enjoy!
