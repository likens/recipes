directions:
  - direction: Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Once boiling,
      add the egg and cook for exactly 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly; rinse under
      cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Refill
      the pot with salted water and heat to boiling on high. When cool enough to
      handle, carefully peel the cooked egg; transfer to a medium bowl.
  - direction: While the egg cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the shallot
      and mince to get 2 tablespoons; place in a bowl with the vinegar. Large
      dice the potatoes. Pick the tarragon leaves off the stems; discard the
      stems and roughly chop. Snap off and discard the bean stems; cut into
      2-inch pieces. Halve the tomatoes. Peel and mince the garlic; smash with
      the side of your knife until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Small
      dice the cornichons.
  - direction: Add the potatoes to the pot of boiling water and cook 10 to 12
      minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain thoroughly and
      return to the pot. Off the heat, stir in the shallot-vinegar mixture, half
      the tarragon and 2 tablespoons of olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
      Using a fork, mash the mixture to your desired consistency; season with
      salt and pepper to taste. Set aside in a warm place.
  - direction: While the potatoes cook, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one),
      heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the beans;
      season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes,
      or until slightly softened. Add Â½ cup of water and cook, stirring
      occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until the water has cooked off. Add the
      tomatoes and garlic paste; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Transfer to a
      bowl. Wipe out the pan.
  - direction: While the vegetables cook, using a fork, mash the peeled egg until
      crumbly. Add the dijonnaise, cornichons and remaining tarragon; stir to
      thoroughly combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - direction: Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels; season with salt and
      pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
      medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fillets, skin sides down; cook 3
      to 5 minutes on the first side, or until browned and crispy. Flip and cook
      1 to 2 minutes, or until cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Remove
      from heat. Divide the mashed potatoes between 2 dishes. Top with the
      cooked fillets and cooked vegetables. Serve with the sauce gribiche on the
      side. Enjoy!
