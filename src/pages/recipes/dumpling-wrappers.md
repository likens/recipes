ingredients:
  - quantity: "3"
    measurement: cup
    name: All-purpose flour
  - quantity: "1"
    measurement: cup
    name: Boiling Water
  - quantity: "3"
    measurement: tablespoon
    name: cold water
directions:
  - direction: Using an electric mixer, place the flour in the work bowl of the
      mixer and slowly mix in the boiling water with a dough hook until
      incorporated and then add the cold water to form a dough. Alternatively,
      to mix by hand, repeat the same instructions but use chopsticks or a
      butter knife to mix in the boiling water, then add the cold water, then
      take it out and knead it for 5 minutes or until soft and smooth.
  - direction: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by
      hand for an additional 5 minutes, or until it's soft and smooth.
  - direction: Divide the dough into smallers sections (6 works well). Take one
      section out and cover the rest with plastic wrap.
  - direction: Run each section through a pasta roller, until it's on the second to
      last setting, and using a 3" round cookie cutter cut out as many wrappers
      as you can. Reuse dough as you can. Alternatively, you can roll the dough
      into long snakes about 1" in diameter and cut small sections, and hand
      roll them to a circle.
