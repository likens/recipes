directions:
  - direction: "Mixing: Add all the ingredients to the mixing bowl and mix on first
      speed for 3 minutes to incorporate ingredients. The dough will be stiff.
      Turn the mixer to second speed and mix for an additional 5 to 6 minutes
      until the dough has moderately strong gluten development. Desired Dough
      temperature 75 F."
  - direction: "Bulk Fermentation: 2 Hours"
  - direction: "Folding: Fold the dough once, after 1 hour of bulk fermentation"
  - direction: "Dividing and Shaping: Try to cut squarish pieces at 3 ounces each.
      Roll up the dough pieces into blunt cylinders. Use the heel of your hands
      to get a tight seam on the bottom edge. Let the dough relax for a few
      minutes under plastic wrap. To shape the pretzels, roll the cylinder to
      about 18 inches long. The center should be thicker than the ends. Do leave
      a small bulb of dough at each end. "
  - direction: "Pick up the dough at the ends and with a quick motion, twirl the
      dough in such a way that it twists around itself twice. As soon as the
      second twist has occurred, quickly lay the thick part of the pretzel down,
      still holding the ends in each hand. Take the ends and press them into the
      dough at each side. The little bulbs of dough at the ends should protrude
      just barely outside the body of the dough. "
  - direction: "Final Fermentation: Let the pretzels proof until about 50 percent
      risen, 20 to 30 minutes at 75 F. Refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes
      to chill the pretzels and to allow formation of a skin. This makes them
      more durable for the dipping to come."
  - direction: "Be sure to wear gloves, the further up the arm the better (and
      goggles to be safer), a stainless steel bowl and stainless steel spoon.
      Add water to bowl and then lye to water and mix until dissolved. "
  - direction: "With a cooling rack on a sheet pan set up, dip the pretzels in the
      lye solution, and leave them in the solution for about 5 seconds, and
      place on the cooling rack to drain for a few seconds, then place them onto
      sheet pan with lightly oiled parchment paper. Sprinkle coarse salt lightly
      over the top, thickest part of the pretzel. Using a sharp knife, make one
      quick slash along the thickest part of the pretzel. "
  - direction: "Discard leftover solution by flushing it down the toilet. "
  - direction: "Baking: Bake them in a preheated oven at 450 F for 14 to 16 minutes.
      The lye dissipates completely in the oven, and the warm pretzel is left to
      be enjoyed either plain or with mustard or with cheese."
