    quantity: "1"
  - name: bunch of mint
    quantity: "1"
  - name: golden raisins
    quantity: "3"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: 1 inch piece of ginger
    quantity: "1"
  - name: dried coconut flakes
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: cup
  - name: curry catfish spice blend (madras curry powder, rice flour)
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: chutney spice blend (brown mustard seeds, yellow mustard seeds, nigella
      seeds)
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: teaspoon
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and mince the garlic. Snap off
      and discard the stem ends of the green beans; cut into ¼-inch pieces. Peel
      and mince the ginger. Pick the cilantro and mint leaves off the stems;
      discard the stems. Roughly chop the raisins. Quarter the lime.
  - direction: In a medium pot, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until
      hot. Add the garlic, green beans and half the ginger; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened and
      fragrant. Add the rice, a big pinch of salt and 1½ cups of water. Heat to
      boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12
      to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is
      tender. Remove from heat. Stir in the coconut flakes and half the cilantro
      and mint (roughly chopping just before adding); season with salt and
      pepper to taste.
  - direction: While the rice cooks, heat a medium, dry pan (nonstick, if you have
      one) on medium-high until hot. Add the chutney spice blend and cook,
      stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes, or until toasted and fragrant. Add
      the raisins and remaining ginger; season with salt and pepper. Cook,
      stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the ginger is
      fragrant. Add ½ cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4
      minutes, or until the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat. Stir in the
      juice of 2 lime wedges; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to
      a bowl. Rinse and wipe out the pan.
  - direction: While the rice continues to cook, place the curry catfish spice blend
      on a plate. Pat the catfish fillets dry with paper towels; season with
      salt and pepper on both sides. Thoroughly coat the seasoned fillets in the
      spice blend (tapping off any excess). Transfer to a plate.
  - direction: In the pan used to make the chutney, heat a thin layer of oil on
      medium-high until hot. Once the oil is hot enough that a small pinch of
      spice blend sizzles immediately when added to the pan, add the coated
      catfish fillets. Cook 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and
      cooked through. Remove from heat.
  - direction: Divide the coconut rice and cooked catfish fillets between 2 dishes.
      Top the catfish with the chutney. Garnish with the remaining lime wedges
      and remaining cilantro and mint. Enjoy!
