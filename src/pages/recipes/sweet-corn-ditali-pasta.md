ingredients:
  - name: Ditali Pasta
    measurement: pound
    quantity: 1/2
  - name: Multicolored Cherry Tomatoes
    quantity: "4"
    measurement: ounce
  - name: cloves of garlic
    quantity: "2"
  - name: ear of corn
    quantity: "1"
  - name: bunch of basil
    quantity: "1"
  - name: Fromage Blanc
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: jalapeno pepper
    quantity: "1"
  - name: shallot
    quantity: "1"
  - name: ricotta cheese
    quantity: 1/2
    measurement: cup
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. Remove and discard the husks and silks of the corn. Cut
      the corn kernels off the cob; discard the cob. Peel and small dice the
      shallot. Peel and mince the garlic. Quarter the tomatoes; place in a bowl
      and season with salt and pepper. Pick the basil leaves off the stems;
      discard the stems. Cut out and discard the stem, ribs and seeds of the
      pepper; small dice. Thoroughly wash your hands after handing the pepper.
  - direction: In a large, high-sided pan (or pot), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
      medium until hot. Add the corn and pepper; season with salt and pepper.
      Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned and
      slightly softened. Add the shallot and garlic; season with salt and
      pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened and
      fragrant. Remove from heat.
  - direction: While the vegetables cook, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water
      and cook 9 to 11 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the
      bite). Reserving Â½ cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.
  - direction: While the pasta cooks, place the ricotta cheese in a bowl; stir in a
      drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - direction: To the pan, add the cooked pasta, seasoned tomatoes, half the basil
      (tearing just before adding) and half the reserved pasta cooking water.
      Cook on medium-high, stirring vigorously to coat the pasta, 2 to 3
      minutes, or until thoroughly combined. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually
      add the remaining pasta cooking water to achieve your desired
      consistency.) Turn off the heat. Add the fromage blanc and seasoned
      ricotta cheese; stir to thoroughly combine. Season with salt and pepper to
      taste.
  - direction: Divide the finished pasta between 2 dishes. Garnish with the
      remaining basil (tearing just before adding). Enjoy!
