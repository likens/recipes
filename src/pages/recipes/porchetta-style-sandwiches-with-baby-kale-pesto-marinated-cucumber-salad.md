    quantity: "1"
  - name: bunch of parsley
    quantity: "1"
  - name: capers
    quantity: 1 1/2
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: grated parmesan cheese
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: cup
  - name: crushed red pepper flakes
    quantity: 1/4
    measurement: teaspoon
  - name: porchetta spice blend (ground fennel seed, whole fennel seeds, ground

    quantity: "2"
    measurement: teaspoon
directions:
  - direction: Preheat the oven to 450°F. Pat the pork dry with paper towels; season
      on all sides with salt, pepper, the spice blend and as much of the red
      pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to
      be. Rub the seasonings into the pork. In a medium pan, heat 2 teaspoons of
      olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned pork and cook,
      turning occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until browned on all sides.
      Transfer the seared pork to a foil-lined sheet pan, leaving any browned
      bits (or fond) in the pan on the stove. Roast 18 to 20 minutes, or until
      cooked through. (An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.)
      Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board, leaving the oven on.
      Let the roasted pork rest for at least 5 minutes.
  - direction: While the pork sears, wash and dry the fresh produce. Using a peeler,
      remove the yellow rind of the lemon, avoiding the white pith; mince the
      rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter and deseed the
      lemon. Peel and mince the garlic; using the flat side of your knife, smash
      until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Place the garlic paste in a
      bowl with the juice of all 4 lemon wedges; season with salt. Large dice
      the cucumber. Pick the parsley leaves off the stems; discard the stems.
      Roughly chop the capers. Halve the rolls.
  - direction: While the pork roasts, heat the pan of reserved fond on medium-high
      until hot. (If the pan seems dry, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil.) Add the
      kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds
      to 1 minute, or until wilted. Add ½ cup of water and cook, stirring
      occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until the water has cooked off. Transfer
      the cooked kale to a cutting board; finely chop.
  - direction: While the pork continues to roast, in a large bowl, combine the
      cucumber, parsley and half the garlic-lemon mixture. Drizzle with olive
      oil; season with salt and pepper to taste. In a medium bowl, combine the
      chopped kale, cheese, capers, lemon zest and remaining garlic-lemon
      mixture. Slowly stir in enough olive oil to create a rough paste; season
      with salt and pepper to taste.
  - direction: While the pork rests, place the rolls on a sheet pan, cut sides up.
      Drizzle with olive oil. Toast in the oven 4 to 6 minutes, or until the
      edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and divide between 2
      dishes.
  - direction: Find the lines of muscle (or grain) of the rested pork; thinly slice
      against the grain. Spread a layer of the pesto onto the cut sides of the
      toasted rolls. Top each roll bottom with half the sliced pork and a
      spoonful of the cucumber marinating liquid; season with salt and pepper.
      Finish with the roll tops. Serve with the salad. Enjoy!
