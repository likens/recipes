    measurement: ounce
  - name: rice vinegar
    quantity: "2"

  - name: sweet white miso paste
    quantity: "2"
    measurement: tablespoon

  - name: gochujang
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: sesame oil
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: tablespoon
directions:
  - direction: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to
      boiling on high. Peel and mince the ginger. Cut off and discard the root
      ends of the scallions; thinly slice on an angle, separating the white
      bottoms and green tops. Medium dice the eggplant. Halve the cucumber
      lengthwise; cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick pieces. Transfer the cucumber
      to a bowl and season with salt and pepper.
  - direction: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat half the sesame oil
      on medium-high until hot. Add the ginger and white bottoms of the
      scallions; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2
      minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add the miso paste, ½ cup of
      water and as much of the gochujang as you’d like, depending on how spicy
      you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or
      until thoroughly combined and slightly thickened. Transfer to a large
      bowl. Stir in the vinegar; season with salt and pepper to taste. Rinse and
      wipe out the pan.
  - direction: In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until
      hot. Add the eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or
      until browned and slightly softened; season with salt and pepper. Transfer
      to the bowl of dressing and toss to coat. Wipe out the pan.
  - direction: Pat the salmon dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on
      both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high
      until hot. Add the seasoned salmon, skin sides down, and cook 3 to 4
      minutes on the first side, or until browned and crispy. Flip and cook 1 to
      2 minutes, or until cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Remove from
      heat.
  - direction: While the salmon cooks, add the noodles to the pot of boiling water
      and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and rinse under
      warm water to prevent sticking. Transfer the cooked noodles, seasoned
      cucumber and remaining sesame oil to the bowl of dressed eggplant. Toss to
      thoroughly coat; season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the baby greens
      and toss to thoroughly combine. Divide between 2 dishes. Top with the
      cooked salmon. Garnish with the green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!
