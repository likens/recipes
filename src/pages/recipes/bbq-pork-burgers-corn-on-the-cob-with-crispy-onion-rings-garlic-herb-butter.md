directions:
  - direction: Remove the butter from the refrigerator to soften. Wash and dry the
      fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Peel
      the onion and thinly slice into rings; separate the layers and place in a
      bowl of cold water. Peel and mince the garlic; smash with the side of your
      knife until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Finely chop the
      parsley leaves and stems. Remove and discard the corn husks and silks;
      halve the cob. Halve the buns.

      fresh produce. Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Peel
      the onion and thinly slice into rings; separate the layers and place in a
      bowl of cold water. Peel and mince the garlic; smash with the side of your
      knife until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Finely chop the
      parsley leaves and stems. Remove and discard the corn husks and silks;
      halve the cob. Halve the buns.
  - direction: Thoroughly drain the onion; pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to a
      bowl. Add the flour and toss to thoroughly coat. In a medium pan
      (nonstick, if you have one), heat a thin layer of oil on medium-high until
      hot. Once hot enough that a pinch of flour sizzles immediately when added
      to the pan, working in batches, add the coated onion in a single, even
      layer. Cook, turning occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown
      and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; immediately season with
      salt and pepper. Set aside in a warm place. Carefully discard the oil and
      wipe out the pan.
  - direction: While the onion cooks, in a medium bowl, combine the ground pork
      (removing and discarding the paper lining from the bottom) and mustard;
      season with salt and pepper. Gently mix to combine. Using your hands, form
      the mixture into two Â½-inch-thick patties. Transfer to a plate. In the
      same pan, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the
      patties and cook, loosely covering the pan with foil, 3 to 4 minutes per
      side, or until browned and cooked through. Transfer to a plate, leaving
      any browned bits (or fond) in the pan. Loosely cover the cooked patties
      with foil.
  - direction: While the patties cook, add the corn to the pot of boiling water and
      cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until bright yellow and slightly softened. Drain
      thoroughly and return to the pot. Off the heat, add the garlic-herb butter
      and toss to thoroughly coat. Set aside in a warm place.
  - direction: Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; heat on
      medium-high until hot. Add the buns, cut sides down, and toast 1 to 2
      minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer to a work surface. Spread half
      the barbecue sauce onto the toasted bun bottoms. Top with the cooked
      patties, remaining barbecue sauce and onion rings. Complete the burgers
      with the bun tops. Divide the burgers, dressed corn and pickle chips
      between 2 plates. Enjoy!
