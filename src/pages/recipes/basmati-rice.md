ingredients:
  - name: Indian basmati rice
    quantity: "1"
    measurement: cup
  - name: water
    quantity: "1.75"
    measurement: cup
  - name: unsalted butter
    quantity: "1.5"
    measurement: tablespoon
  - name: salt
    quantity: 1/2
    measurement: teaspoon
directions:
  - direction: Place the rice in medium bowl and add enough water to cover by 2
      inches. Using your hands, gently swish the grains to release any excess
      starch. Carefully pour off the water, leaving the rice in the bowl. Repeat
      four times, or until the water runs almost clear. Using a fine mesh
      strainer, drain the rice
  - direction: In a medium pot, bring the water, butter, salt, and rice to a boil.
      Cover the pot with a tight fitting lid, then turn the heat down to a
      simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the water is absorbed
      and the rice is tender. If the rice is still too firm, add a few more
      tablespoons of water and continue cooking for a few minutes more. Remove
      the pan from the heat and allow it to sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff the
      rice with a fork and serve
